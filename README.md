# Advent of Code 2023

An attempt to complete [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl)'s 2023 edition
of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an advent calendar with 50 programming puzzles. I will try to complete
the challenge on a daily basis, but I'll be happy if I manage to complete all 50 challenges by the end date.

I'm participating on the challenge just for fun, so I will not spend too much time keeping the project all clean and
tidy. If you're snooping around, don't judge my coding skills just yet.

## Usage

The scripts solving each of the challenges should be self-contained (or at least that's my intention at the time of
writing). To run the script for a given day, execute:

```commandline
python advent_calendar/day_1/day1.py -h
```
